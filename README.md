# day45_100
I am currently engaged in a 100-day Python Bootcamp, which I am documenting and sharing my progress on GitHub. The boot camp is designed to progressively intensify, allowing me to deepen my understanding and proficiency in Python programming.

Additionally, I have chosen to include the beginner, intermediate and advanced in my documentation to provide a valuable reference for my future growth and development.

# Scraping Data from Hacker News with BeautifulSoup
In this project, I learned how to use Python's BeautifulSoup library along with requests to scrape data from websites. Here's a snippet of code that demonstrates fetching and parsing data from Hacker News

## What I Learned
- __BeautifulSoup Basics:__ How to initialize BeautifulSoup and parse HTML content.
- __Finding Elements:__ Using BeautifulSoup to find specific HTML elements by class and tag name.
- __Data Extraction:__ Extracting article titles, links, and upvote counts from Hacker News.
- __Handling Data:__ Storing data in lists and performing operations such as finding the article with the most upvotes.
